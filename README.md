======================

Example code for handling sensor data on Android

## Context

In this Android example we'll try to cover sensor management and all things we believe you need to
know to do so properly. Think of opening sensors for reading but also closing them when done. Once
opened how to handle the data, like smoothing with moving average, triggering stuff on tresholds
and more. And sure we'll have to do some of these tasks in de background so we'll also have to make
sure we don't drain the battery too much.

I'll try to make it usefull also. This will probably turn into a highly configurable app that can
trigger stuff (like wake your device) one certain tresholds. That "wake your device" goal is
something I personally need and didn't find a good working alternative for. If possible I'll see
if the app can do more than waking up.
